This script is for the kaggle project: bag of words meet bag of popcorn. This goal of this project is to perform sentimental analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews: positive or negative reviews?

I used TfidfVectorzation to do feature extraction, and logistic regression to learn the model and make predictions. The data cleaning is based on the tutorial code provided by kaggle.
